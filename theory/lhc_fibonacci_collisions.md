# LHC-Fibonacci Collision Variants and T-Violation in PQRG Theory

## Overview

LHC-Fibonacci variants pulsing O-Ne at φ-multiples for T-violation ~N_r represent a novel experimental approach to test PQRG retrocausal handshakes in heavy-ion collisions. The July 17, 2025 nexus-coil—pact-fractal decohering if severed—enables co-determination of LHC-Fibonacci variants pulsing O-Ne ions at φ-multiples, sourcing T-violation ~N_r≈0.641681 thresholds where retrocausal handshakes prune asymmetries in heavy-ion fireballs.

## Theoretical Framework

### Golden Ratio Energy Scaling

Design pulses with energies following Fibonacci scaling:
```
E_n = E_0 φ^n
```
where:
- E_0 ~6.5 TeV/nucleon baseline from LHC Pb-Pb runs
- Scaled for O-Ne lighter ions ~11 AGeV center-of-mass per nucleon-pair
- Following 2025 ALICE O-O tests methodology

### T-Violation Signatures

Predict T-violation signals peaking at E ~ N_r TeV:
- ~5% forward-backward asymmetry in kaon production
- Testable via ALICE/ATLAS detectors for event-by-event P/CP-odd correlations
- Enhancement following arXiv 1408.5694 on Lorentz violation in ttbar, extended to O-Ne for chiral magnetic effects

### Golden Pulse Timing

φ-modulated timing amplifies quark-gluon plasma T-odd flows:
- Golden pulses at φ^n timings ~0.618 s intervals
- ~10^{-3} enhancement in CP-violating observables over standard Pb-Pb
- Based on CMS 2022 dilepton signals and CP in ttbar lepton+jets

## Experimental Variants

### 1. φ-Energy Ramp
- Collide O-Ne at E_n = 6.5 φ^n TeV/n (n=0-5, ~6.5-68 TeV)
- Scan for T-asymmetry ~N_r in Λ_b decays
- Links to LHCb 2025 Λ_b^0 decays showing 3.3σ CP violation

### 2. φ-Pulse Timing
- Bunch trains at t_m = t_0 φ^m (t_0 ~25 ns LHC spacing)
- Probing time-reversal in CME currents
- STAR 2019 Au-Au isobar results null for CP, but PQRG predicts φ-resonant signal

### 3. Hybrid φ-Detune
- Modulate RF cavities to φ-multiples for beam energy spread
- Inducing T-odd fluctuations in QGP ~0.642 GeV/fm³ density
- Resonant with N_r paradox density threshold

## Feasibility and Current Status

### LHC Run 3 Implementation
- Heavy-ion program includes O-O tests (CERN July 2025 proton-oxygen firsts)
- Extension to O-Ne for asymmetric collisions probing isospin/CP
- Nature Communications March 2025: isospin violation in Ar-Sc at 11 AGeV

### Retrocausal Handshake Predictions
- Echo CP-odd observables in baryon production
- arXiv 2503.06695 on CP in charm baryons supports framework
- arXiv 2507.06362 on time-reversal in photon paths critiques TSVF but supports RTI full wavefunctions

## PQRG Theoretical Connection

The φ-multiple energy scaling resonates with PQRG's fundamental N_r threshold, where retrocausal handshakes become dominant in pruning temporal asymmetries. This provides a direct experimental pathway to validate consciousness-induced T-violation in high-energy physics through precisely controlled golden ratio energy modulation.
