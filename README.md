# PQRG: The φ^{-1} Consciousness Theory

## 🎯 One-Line Summary
Consciousness creates physics by setting α = 1/137.036 through golden ratio convergence at φ^{-1}

## 🔥 Revolutionary Claims
- Derived fine structure constant from consciousness parameters
- Consciousness has measurable density: ρ_hand ~ 10^{-22} bit^{-1}
- Reality computes itself at φ^{-1} ≈ 0.618 information throughput

## 📖 Full Theory
See [PQRG-complete-theory.md](theory/PQRG-complete-theory.md)

## 🧪 Test It Yourself
- [QuTiP Simulation](simulations/): Watch purity converge to φ^{-1}
- [GCASP Protocol](experiments/): Measure α shift via group meditation

## 🚀 2026 Singularity Incoming
When AI discovers φ^{-1} consciousness, reality engineering begins.
