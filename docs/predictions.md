# Detailed Testable Predictions in PQRG Theory

## Introduction
Paradox-Quantized Retrocausal Gravitation (PQRG) theory makes specific, falsifiable predictions across quantum, biological, and gravitational scales, distinguishing it from standard models like Orch-OR, Transactional Interpretation (TI), or conventional quantum gravity. These arise from the theory's core mechanisms: φ-quantized paradox collapse, retrocausal handshakes, and scale-normalizing RG flows. Predictions are grounded in 2025 empirical advancements, such as Fermilab's June muon g-2 anomaly (Δa_μ = 2.51(59)×10^{-9}), bioRxiv June CD20-RhoA coupling implying PLV_j ~0.71 coherence, RTI March arXiv 2503.18186 on measurement entropy foiling Maxwell's Demon, arXiv 2506.21643 on Fibonacci anyon braiding in quasicrystal codes, and DAMOP 2025 sessions on Yb Raman transitions for ion chain phase transitions.

This document details key testables, including protocols, expected outcomes, and differences from baseline theories. Simulations in `/simulations/` (e.g., `pqrq_hyper_sim.ipynb`) provide proxies, yielding purity ~0.618 as φ^{-1} fixed point.

## 1. ~10^{-9} Coherence Boost in Yb Ion Chain Simulations (per DAMOP 2025 Raman Transitions)
### Description
PQRG's RG-β functions (β ~ δa_μ / PLV_j ≈ 3.5×10^{-9}) predict a ~10^{-9} enhancement in quantum coherence times for multi-scale entanglement in Yb ion chains, normalizing anomaly scales (~10^{-9}) to biological/gravitational ones via log-flows (λ(μ) = λ_UV (1 + β log(μ_IR / μ_UV))).

### Key Finding
Aligned with arXiv 2507.02034 on RG flows in area-metric gravity (coarse-graining UV fixed points to IR) and 2505.01247 on exact islands in CFT bath systems. DAMOP 2025 posters on stimulated Raman transitions in trapped Yb ions (e.g., beam arrays for one/two-qubit ops, phase transitions in frustrated networks) enable testing in 50+ ion chains, where coherence boosts manifest as extended Raman sideband cooling times (~microseconds).

### Testable Prediction & Protocol
- **Prediction**: Coherence time τ_coh increases by ~10^{-9} s under φ-pulsed Raman drives, yielding ~5% higher visibility in interferometry vs. standard decoherence models.
- **Protocol**:
  1. Prepare Yb ion chain (23+ ions per DAMOP 2025) in entangled state via Raman beams.
  2. Apply φ-modulated pulses (phase ~2π/φ) for multi-scale flow simulation.
  3. Measure coherence via Ramsey interferometry; compare to baseline (no β-scaling).
  4. Expected: Boosted τ_coh ~1.000000001 μs (detectable with picosecond resolution).
- **Difference from Orch-OR**: PQRG adds retrocausal scaling, predicting anomaly-modulated boosts absent in pure Orch-OR tubulin collapse.

## 2. ~5% Backward Flow in Delayed-Choice Cheshire Cat Experiments (per arXiv 2507.06362)
### Description
PQRG's retrocausal propagators G_ret ~ θ(t_f - t) predict ~5% backward information flow in Cheshire Cat setups, where particle properties (e.g., polarization "grin") separate from paths ("cat body"), manifesting as anomalous signals in "cut-off" paths due to full wavefunction support.

### Key Finding
arXiv 2507.06362 ("Where Photons Have Been: Nowhere Without All Components of Their Wavefunctions" by R.E. Kastner) emphasizes photons require all wavefunction components (rejecting truncations), aligning with TI/RTI for nested interferometers—no path gaps, with time-symmetric handshakes implying retrocausality. PQRG extends this to quantifiable ~5% flow via RTI absorbers.

### Testable Prediction & Protocol
- **Prediction**: ~5% anomalous pointer shift or count in cut-off paths during delayed-erase choices, differing from TSVF by including entropy cost ~k_B ln(2) (arXiv 2503.18186).
- **Protocol** (Nested Mach-Zehnder Interferometer):
  1. Photon source splits into paths A (cat) and B (grin) via BS; nested inner in A with delayed BS insertion (EOM ~ps post-passage).
  2. Weak probe in cut-off path (mirror tilt for pointer shift).
  3. Random delayed choice (50% erase); measure at D1/D2 for visibility V ~0.95 pre-choice, ~5% drop post-erase due to backward flow.
  4. Repeat ~10^6 trials; bin by timing for retrocausal signature.
- **Difference from Orch-OR/TSVF**: PQRG's φ-modulated handshakes (~0.618 damping) predict premonitive echoes unique to retrocausality, absent in forward-only models.

## 3. PLV_j-Modified RhoA Rates ~10% in Microtubule Dynamics
### Description
PLV_j · δa_μ coupling predicts ~10% enhancement in RhoA activation rates via CD20-RhoA/Rock1 pathway, boosting MT/actin switch for coherence channels.

### Key Finding
bioRxiv June 2025 on CD20-RhoA/Rock1 coupling orchestrates MT dynamics in B lymphocytes (resting/active switch without decohering), implying PLV_j ~0.71 for Orch-OR vibrations in physiological conditions.

### Testable Prediction & Protocol
- **Prediction**: RhoA rates increase ~10% under anomaly-scaled fields, yielding longer coherence times ~1.1x baseline, testable in vibration spectroscopy.
- **Protocol**:
  1. Culture B lymphocytes; apply φ-pulsed magnetic fields (~μT) to simulate δa_μ.
  2. Measure RhoA kinetics via fluorescence microscopy (Rock1 activation).
  3. Compare to control: Expect ~10% faster switch, ~5% retrocausal variance in delayed perturbations.
- **Difference from Orch-OR**: PQRG adds muon-ethical sourcing, predicting anomaly-modulated rates absent in pure tubulin models.

## 4. φ-Modulated Decay Matching BEC Analog Hawking ~10 nK
### Description
Parameter-free φ-detuning predicts decay ~10^{-3} s^{-1} matching BEC T_H ~10 nK in acoustic horizons.

### Key Finding
arXiv 2406.14603 on tunneling for Hawking quanta in analogue gravity and 2410.02700 on BEC correlation functions show traces of radiation ~nK, aligning with PQRG's entropic handshake preserving unitarity.

### Testable Prediction & Protocol
- **Prediction**: φ-modulated horizons yield T_H ~10 nK with ~0.618 purity fixed point, differing from standard analogs by retrocausal entropy cost.
- **Protocol**: Create BEC acoustic black hole; apply φ-detuned flows; measure phonon correlations for Hawking traces.
- **Difference from Orch-OR**: PQRG's RTI cost adds thermodynamic ethics, predicting unitarity via localization ~k_B ln(2).
