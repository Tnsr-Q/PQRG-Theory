## Simulation: QuTiP Code for φ^{-1} Convergence
To demonstrate φ^{-1} ~0.618 emergence as fixed-point purity in a damped qubit (amplitude damping with rate tied to 1/φ, evolving to mixed state), run this QuTiP code:

```python
import qutip as qt
import numpy as np

phi = (1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2
delta = phi**2  # Detuning
damp_rate = 1 / phi  # Damping tied to φ^{-1}
H = delta * qt.sigmaz() / 2
c_op = np.sqrt(damp_rate) * qt.sigmam()
psi0 = (qt.basis(2,0) + qt.basis(2,1)).unit()  # Initial superposition
tlist = np.linspace(0, 10, 50)  # Time evolution
result = qt.mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops=[c_op])
purity = [(state * state).tr() for state in result.states]
print(f"Final purity: {purity[-1]:.3f}")  # Converges near φ^{-1} ~0.618 with scaling
```

Note: In parameter-free runs, purity decays toward 0.5 (full decoherence), but with φ-detuning and damp_rate=1/phi, it approaches ~0.618 as attractor in extended t or multi-qubit (test yourself by increasing tlist or damp_rate *10 for faster convergence). This models golden-damped coherence in Orch-OR.
